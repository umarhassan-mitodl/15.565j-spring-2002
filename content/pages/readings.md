Madnick, Stuart, and Y. Richard Wang. _A Framework of Composite Information Systems for Strategic Advantage_. _Proceedings of the 1988 Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,_ January 1988, pp. 35-43.

> One important category of strategic applications involves inter-corporate linkage or intra-corporate integration. Applications in this category require multiple systems to work together. This category of Information Systems is referred to as _Composite Information Systems_ (CIS). This paper presents the research issues and directions that may lead to a comprehensive foundation of CIS. This paper also investigates the strategic, technical, and organizational issues involved in CIS and the corresponding research directions.

Evans, Philip, and Thomas Wurster. _Getting Real About Virtual Commerce_. Boston, MA: _Harvard Business Review,_ November-December 1999, pp. 85-94.

> This paper discusses the notions of reach, richness, affiliation, and the role of navigators. Reach is the degree of access and connections, sources and receivers. Richness is the depth and detail of information system gives and collects. Affiliation is the degree to which the user's interests are represented. There is a major focus on "navigators" which will have enormous power and market value and "meta" navigators which can help compare multiple e-retailers.

Information Technology, Corporate Strategy, and Competitive Advantage
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


Porter, Michael, and Victor Millar. _How Information Gives You Competitive Advantage_. Boston, MA: _Harvard Business Review,_ July-August 1985, pp. 149-160.

> Presents a summary of the key ideas from Porter's widely-cited books _Competitive Strategy_ and _Competitive Advantage._ It identifies **five forces** that determine industry profitability:
> 
> 1.  the entry of new competitors
> 2.  the threat of substitutes
> 3.  the power of buyers
> 4.  the power of suppliers, and
> 5.  rivalry among the existing competitors.
> 
> It also proposes three generic strategies for success:

> 1.  cost leadership
> 2.  differentiation, and
> 3.  focus.

> Another important concept is the **value chain**. The five major components of the value chain are:
> 
> 1.  inbound logistics
> 2.  operations
> 3.  outbound logistics
> 4.  marketing & sales, and
> 5.  service.
> 
> There are three infrastructure activities that support the value chain:
> 
> 1.  human resource management
> 2.  technology development, and
> 3.  procurement.
> 
> The value chain provides a systematic way to examine all the activities of a firm. Linkages, or "connectivity", between value chains is an important way to exploit strategic advantages. Furthermore, this article identifies three ways that **technology affects competition**:
> 
> 1.  it alters industry structure
> 2.  it supports cost and differentiation strategies, and
> 3.  it spawns new businesses.

Porter, Michael E. _Strategy and the Internet_. _Harvard Business Review,_ March 2001, pp. 63-78.

> Also uses the five forces model and value chain model, but in the context of the Internet. He argues that the Internet does not change the "old rules". He dispels many Internet myths, which have become more obvious in recent years, and illustrates that the "old rules" are also the "new rules." He also suggests six principles for Strategic Positioning:
> 
> 1.  right goal
> 2.  value proposition
> 3.  distinctive value chain
> 4.  trade-offs
> 5.  fit, and
> 6.  continuity of direction.

Aggregators: The New Business on the Internet
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


Madnick, Stuart, and Michael Siegel. _Seize the Opportunity: Exploiting Web Aggregation_. MIT Sloan School of Management Working Paper, December 2001 (to appear in _MISQ Executive_).

> This paper examines the development of aggregators, entities that collect information from a wide range of sources, with or without prior arrangements, and add value through post-aggregation services. Two key types of aggregators are comparison and relationship aggregators. It also suggests different business models as possible aggregator entry points into an industry and describes their impact on the value chain.

> A "schema" is a representation of all the data to be managed by an organization. In the context of distributed database systems and inter-organizational systems, it may be necessary to use data that spans two or more organizations. This paper addresses the issue of integrating the individual database schemas. It discusses various causes of schema differences and various approaches to solving these problems.

Ross, Jeanne. _The ERP Revolution: Surviving Versus Thriving_. MIT CISR Working Paper. November 1998, pp. 1-10.

> Describes motivations for ERPs: Infrastructure (common platform), Capability (process improve, data visibility), and Performance (cost reduction, decision making, customer responsiveness). Major difficulties and success factors: (1) metrics, (2) on-going resources, (3) management reporting, and (4) addressing resistance. Major point is that standardized processes and data is key to flexibility.

Weick, Karl. _Educational Organizations as Loosely Coupled Systems_. _Administrative Science Quarterly_ 21, March 1976, pp. 1-19.

> Presents the notion of "loosely coupled" organizations, using educational organizations as examples.

Furthermore, he presents seven advantages of loose coupling.
